# MapLibre Repository Statistics

This repository gathers statistics using [github-repo-stats](https://github.com/jgehrcke/github-repo-stats). This is done to overcome a limitation of GitHub, which by default only shows data for the past 14 days.

Create a PR that modifies `.github/workflows/store-repostats.yml` if you would like to fetch data for another repo.
