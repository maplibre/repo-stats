# Repository Statistics

This repository gathers statistics using [github-repo-stats](https://github.com/jgehrcke/github-repo-stats). This is done to overcome a limitation of GitHub, which by default only shows data for the past 14 days.

Raw data is available on the [github-repo-stats](https://github.com/maplibre/repo-stats/tree/github-repo-stats) branch.

Create a PR that modifies `.github/workflows/store-repostats.yml` if you would like to fetch data for another repo.
